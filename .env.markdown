# Environment file info

If you're running in production, you should set these securely.

However, if you just want to experiment, set the following values

## ArangoDB settings

Note, this code will not install an ArangoDB instance.

If you're new to ArangoDB, [you can install the community edition quickly by following the instructions here](https://arangodb.com/community-server/).

* `ARANGODB_HOST`: `127.0.0.1`
	* default host above
* `ARANGODB_PORT`: `8529`
	* default port above
* `ARANGODB_USERNAME`: `root`
	* default root user above
* `ARANGODB_PASSWORD`: USE PASSWORD OF ARANGODB_USERNAME
	* default for `root` is blank (but depends on install method)

## stix2arango setting

* `ALWAYS_LATEST`: leave this blank, unless you know what you're doing
	* setting this to `1` will skip the checking of `_is_latest` objects. It will speed up the import but only do this if you know the bundle you are importing does not contain updated objects. Else you will end up with many copies of the same object showing as the latest. For a bit more context, we only ever use this setting on `1` when running the first backfill to Vulmatch (and was the reason it was introduced).
